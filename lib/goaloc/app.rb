# This is Generate on a Lot of Crack, which aims to speed and extend the initial definition of a rails app.
# It was motivated by the fact that to make a nested resource (ie, to get  /posts/1/comments to resolve),
# one must specify the relation between post and comment in 4 places:  the routes, the migration, and in
# both models.  That's silly, and not so DRY.  Enter GoaLoC, and the "blog in 15 minutes" talk essentially
# reduces to:
#   goaloc
#   >> @app.name = "myblog"
#   >> route [:posts, :comments]
#   >> add_attrs :posts => "body:text title:string", :comments => "body:text"
#   >> generate
#
# generate presently only knows how to make rails apps, and part of merb apps, but in principle, any
# REST-centric MVC app could be targeted comfortably, and even PHP apps could be done.

class App
  attr_accessor :name, :routes, :goals, :options, :log

  def initialize(name = nil)
    self.name = (name or generate_name)
    self.routes = []
    self.log = []
    self.goals = HashWithIndifferentAccess.new
  end

  # take in any number of ruby expressions, (presently limited to symbols and nested arrays of symbols),
  # and define those expressions as valid routes.  If the routed resources don't exist, define them,
  # and the relations with other resources implied by the route expression.  For instance, route :posts
  # implies that you'll want a model Post.  More interestingly,
  #   route [:posts, :comments, :wiki]
  # implies that there must be Post, Comment, and Wiki models, and that a Post has many comments and
  # has one wiki.

  # this returns the goal (resource generated by goaloc) named by a given string or symbol.  Goal names
  # are always singular, so it allows for singular or plural variants of anything that responds to #to_s

  end

  # add_attrs takes in a hash of symbol => string pairs, and attaches to the goal named by the key the
  # attributes named in the string.  For example:
  #   add_attrs :posts => "body:text title:string", :ratings => "score:integer"
  # adds an integer field named score to Rating, a text field called body to Post, and a string field
  # called title to Post.
