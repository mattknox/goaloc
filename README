* FIX (url)

== DESCRIPTION:

This is Generate on a Lot of Crack, which started its life as a more powerful script/generate for rails, and may evolve into a multi-framework webapp scaffolder

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

-currently supports only rails, should add merb, maybe erlyweb, maybe others.
-currently, goaloc does not generate useful views for nested resources.  So it is only better than ./script/generate scaffold  in that it makes the models and migrations easier.
it should:
-be easier to remove, rename, etc., attributes.
-support using a suspenders-style app skeleton 
-be better tested internally
-support acts-as-tree things
-have high-level datatypes, like email, url, ssn, etc..
-handle hmt
-handle singular resources
-handle enums, so you can do some of the constraint stuff from PicoLisp

== SYNOPSIS:

Goaloc was motivated by the fact that to make a nested resource (ie, to get  /posts/1/comments to resolve), one must specify the relation between post and comment in 4 places:  the routes, the migration, and in both models.  That's silly, and not so DRY.  Enter GoaLoC, and the "blog in 15 minutes" talk essentially reduces to:

goaloc
>> @app.name = "myblog"
>> route [:posts, :comments]
>> add_attrs :posts => "body:text title:string", :comments => "body:text"
>> generate

generate presently only knows how to make rails apps, and part of merb apps, but in principle, any REST-centric MVC app could be targeted comfortably, and even PHP apps could be done.

How should I handle has_many through?
{:type => :hmt, :a => :users, :b => :causes, :bidi => true }

{:type => :tree, :class => :tasks}  maybe not so interesting, except that it should have wacky routes.

route [:causes, { :has_many => :users, :through => :memberships }, :tasks, ]

== REQUIREMENTS:

shoulda to run tests, possibly ruby2ruby in the future.

== INSTALL:

sudo gem install -s http://gems.github.com mattknox-goaloc
