= goaloc

* http://github.com/mattknox/goaloc/tree

== DESCRIPTION:

This is Generate on a Lot of Crack, which started its life as a more powerful script/generate for rails, and may evolve into a multi-framework webapp scaffolder

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

-currently supports only rails and some merb
it should:
-be easier to remove, rename, etc., attributes.
-support using a rails app specifier like Jeremy McAnally's rg
-support acts-as-tree things
-have high-level datatypes, like email, url, ssn, etc..
-handle enums, so you can do some of the constraint stuff from PicoLisp
-do haml for views (maybe?)
-make it serve goaloc directly (this is maybe really hard)
-handle chained resources better
-include a javascripty interface, so that one can go up the post-comment-rating chain in one page.
-rdoc the whole thing.
-write backend for datamapper
-write backend for haml
-write a merb target
-support singular resources
-write the plugin architecture
-extend goals such that they can be told not to make a controller, or view, or model.
-must make it serve apps next, and then make that compile to other web frameworks.
-must make it pick a directory back up, so you can regenerate over an existing dir.  

==DONE:
-include jquery for js
-include bluetrip css framework
-some rdoc

== SYNOPSIS:

Goaloc was motivated by the fact that to make a nested resource (ie, to get  /posts/1/comments to resolve), one must specify the relation between post and comment in 4 places:  the routes, the migration, and in both models.  That's silly, and not so DRY.  Enter GoaLoC, and the "blog in 15 minutes" talk essentially reduces to:

goaloc
>> @app.name = "myblog"
>> route [:posts, :comments]
>> add_attrs :posts => "body:text title:string", :comments => "body:text"
>> generate

generate presently only knows how to make rails apps, and part of merb apps, but in principle, any REST-centric MVC app could be targeted comfortably, and even PHP apps could be done.

route [:causes, { :class => :users, :through => :memberships }, :tasks, ]

will set up causes has many users through memberships

Possible rewrite:
People keep joking that I should just be able to say "goaloc blog" and get an app.  Is that actually a bad idea?  I'm not sure.  It seems like it would be a great idea to be able to say, for instance, that at any given point, you should be able to include an entire app rooted at the spot in the routes you currently occupy.  Something like this:

route [:users, blog, photogallery]

could make a blog that is accessible through the user object.  Each goal-generating function could come with a bunch of options, like setting authentication, etc.  

This would allow people to make individual web components, possibly including views.

This almost suggests a need for a gem-like system for "goals" (might need a better name for it and for the project as a whole), and really points up the importance of making this servable on its own-it would be great to be able to toss in a component, look at the resulting app, and then change it.
